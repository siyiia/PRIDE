## Run experiments on irrational teacher

To design more realistic models of human teachers, we consider a common stochastic model and systematically manipulate its terms and operators:

```
teacher_beta: rationality constant of stochastic preference model (default: -1 for perfectly rational model)
teacher_gamma: discount factor to model myopic behavior (default: 1)
teacher_eps_mistake: probability of making a mistake (default: 0)
teacher_eps_skip: hyperparameters to control skip threshold (\in [0,1])
teacher_eps_equal: hyperparameters to control equal threshold (\in [0,1])
```

In B-Pref, we tried the following teachers:

`Oracle teacher`: (teacher_beta=-1, teacher_gamma=1, teacher_eps_mistake=0, teacher_eps_skip=0, teacher_eps_equal=0)

`Mistake teacher`: (teacher_beta=-1, teacher_gamma=1, teacher_eps_mistake=0.1, teacher_eps_skip=0, teacher_eps_equal=0)

`Noisy teacher`: (teacher_beta=1, teacher_gamma=1, teacher_eps_mistake=0, teacher_eps_skip=0, teacher_eps_equal=0)

`Skip teacher`: (teacher_beta=-1, teacher_gamma=1, teacher_eps_mistake=0, teacher_eps_skip=0.1, teacher_eps_equal=0)

`Myopic teacher`: (teacher_beta=-1, teacher_gamma=0.9, teacher_eps_mistake=0, teacher_eps_skip=0, teacher_eps_equal=0)

`Equal teacher`: (teacher_beta=-1, teacher_gamma=1, teacher_eps_mistake=0, teacher_eps_skip=0, teacher_eps_equal=0.1)


### PEBBLE

Experiments can be reproduced with the following:

```
./scripts/[env_name]/[teacher_type]/[max_budget]/run_PEBBLE.sh [sampling_scheme: 0=uniform, 1=disagreement, 2=entropy]
```

### PRIDE

Experiments can be reproduced with the following:

```
./scripts/[env_name]/[teacher_type]/[max_budget]/run_PEBwSyn.sh [sampling_scheme: 0=uniform, 1=disagreement, 2=entropy]
```

(Example script code can be found under `scripts/quadruped_walk/2000/oracle/run_PEBwSyn.sh`)
